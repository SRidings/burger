**NODE EXPRESS HANDLEBARS -- Eat-Da-Burger!!**

_In this assignment, I create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). This app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML._

**HOW Eat-Da-Burger WORKS**

_Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat._

_Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured._

_Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page._

_This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not._
